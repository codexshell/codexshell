- 👋 Hi, I’m @codexshell
- 👀 I’m interested in front end all the way to back end
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and React-based frameworks. While exploring I also stumbled across something called SvelteKit, might be a gem!
- Svelte is truly a gem, but even greater is Astro
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front end projects, especially open sourced ones.
- 📫 You can reach me at [@codexshell](https://twitter.com/codexshell)
